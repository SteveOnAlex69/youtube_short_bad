# youtube_short_bad
What does this extension do? If the current tab is Youtube Short, it can convert it into normal Youtube player, which helps a lot since normal Youtube player has infinitely more features, like pause, atjust the video volume, or speed up the video. It's pretty niche, but I find this useful so yeah.

<p> If this useless extension made it on the Google Extension store, then great, but if it didn't, you can install this extension by downloading the folder, then turn on Developer Mode on your browser and choose Load Unpack to load my extension. There are plenty of tutorials online for this I think.

<p> This extension is pretty intuitive to use (I think). You can access the pop-up menu by going to the Extension menu and click on the Extension (YoutubeShortBad). 

  
<p> Then, you can see two buttons: "Convert", which will convert the current site from Youtube Short video player to normal video player, and the toggle button "Always On", which is basically a constantly on "Convert" button. Obviously, it isn't going to do anything if the current site isn't Youtube Short.

<p> You can also right click on any blank space on the site and see the context menu "Convert From Short". Clicking on it will convert the current site to normal Youtube Player. Alternatively, you can press "Ctrl + Shift + S". That's it, thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.
